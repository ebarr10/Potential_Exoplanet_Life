Within this step we want to try and tidy up the data that we just read in. This is an important step because of the fact that it will allow the data to be read and understood with much more fluidity. In our case we would be altering the structure of the DataFrame through the process of tidying data and / or data wrangling.\n",

Another issue that we have with this DataFrame is that the names, due to there being many columns, may not be very intuitive, so in order to be able to understand the column values quicker without a cheat sheet of what each column represents we want to change the column names.\n",

    "Due to space being such a hard thing to measure as we can't just take out a ruler and measure it that way, astronomers typically write down what they believe a value is and then the upper and lower limits of what that value could be.

    "After removing the columns that aren't useful or won't be necessary for our calculations we can do the next step of tidying up our data. This would be to remove the rows that have missing data. Now we don't have to delete every row that is missing data because some columns can be interchangable. An example of an interchangable column is the radius and mass of the planet nut in the units of Earth Radius/Mass or Jupiter Radius/Mass which we can use either value in a formula since in the end we can just convert this value to any radius/mass units that we need. We also want to keep as many columns as we can so that we can get a better analysis.\n",

    "A <ins>Super Earth</ins> is classified as a planet that is between twice the size of Earth and up to 10 times the mass of Earth (for our classification we decided to slightly increase this range so that we could capture exoplanets that were slightly larger than a Super Planet but still had the right ratio to be consider Earth Like). This means that in order to determine whether a planet is more similar to Earth or Jupiter we much check both the mass and radius that is recorded and see whether the exoplanet would be considered in the range of the classification of a Super Earth before we check whether it is more similar to Jupiter.\n",

If the value of the either column is \"nan\" (null) then we will assume that the exoplanet is most similar to the non-null value."

    "Awesome! With the Frost line calculated we can now tell whether the planet will most likely be a terrestrial exoplanet or a gas/ice giant. This would get us a better understanding of which exoplanets could harbor life but before we are quick to judge we should see what the <ins>Effective Temperature</ins> is of the planets because even if it is beyond the frost line, if there is enough heat generated to have liquids contained on the exoplanet then it still has the possibility to harbor some type of life.\n",

    "\n",
    "To give a good example about what a good Effective Temperature is: On Earth the Effective Temperature is 252 K and with Greenhouse Effect is 288 K, so we want a planet that is around these numbers to say that it has a good Effective Temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the Effective Temperature you can use the formula:\n",

    "What does each variable represent?\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. (1 + gamma) represents the light after being reflected by the planet, how much of that light is then reflected again towards the planet\n",
    "    2. (1 - a) represents the amount of heat that is absorbed by the planet (a being the albedo or reflectiveness of a planet)\n",
    "    3. R^2 and T^2, like before represent the radius and temperature of the Host star that the exoplanet revolves around\n",
    "    4. The division by 4 comes from the fact that exoplanets absorb light like a disk but emit heat like a sphere\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, we do not have what the 'gamma' and 'a' values of the exoplanets are however we do have a column called 'pl_eqt' which stands for Equilibrium Temperature. This is very similar to Effective Temperature however its a theoretical temperature that an exoplanet would be heated only based on their host star. \n",
