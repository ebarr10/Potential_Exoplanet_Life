Our goal in this project is to take the exoplanets already discovered and see what the probability of life on these planets real is and hope that a good amount of the exoplanets that we discovered so far fit well into the criteria of haveing the ability to hold life.\n",

    "After you successfully retrieve the data that you are looking for and have it in some sort of dataframe so that you can manipulate it then you move onto this next step. Within this step we want to try and tidy up the data that we just read in. This is an important step because of the fact that it will allow the data to be read and understood with much more fluidity. In our case we would be altering the structure of the DataFrame through the process of tidying data and / or data wrangling.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will now go through the steps of tiding up our DataFrame so that any extra columns are discarded since we will not need them to perform our analysis. We also want to add a few columns to the DataFrame so that when we perform some calculations we can easily convert the column values out of their comparison units (example: 10 Earth Masses, which is just saying that the planet is 10 time the size of Earth). Another issue that we have with this DataFrame is that the names, due to there being many columns, may not be very intuitive, so in order to be able to understand the column values quicker without a cheat sheet of what each column represents we want to change the column names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to space being such a hard thing to measure as we can't just take out a ruler and measure it that way, astronomers typically write down what they believe a value is and then the upper and lower limits of what that value could be. We will be just taking into account what they believe the specific value to be and ignore the upper and lower limits in order to help calculate certian aspects of the exoplanets and host stars much easier.\n",

    "That's great! We can now see that with those that lie within the frost line, 156 of them are also Earth Like. You may be wondering how a planet could be potentially Jupiter like and still be within the frost line, the answer is that they are Hot Jupiters. These are planets that are like Jupiter but have drifted closer to there host star. A truly an amazing topic to learn more about(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Jupiter).\n",
    "\n",
    "With this new view and calculation, we can see how many planets are terrestrial planets versus Gas / Ice Giants this gives us a better understanding of which and how many exoplanets could harbor life but before we are quick to judge we should see what the <ins>Actual Temperature</ins> is of the planets because even if it is beyond the frost line, if there is enough heat generated to have liquids contained on the exoplanet then it still has the possibility to harbor some type of life.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a value called Effective Temperature however this does not take into account Greenhouse Effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about the difference between Effective Temperature and Actual Temperature, we recommend this website:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/difference-between-effective-temp-and-actual-surface-temp-is-due-to-what.494651/\n",
    "\n",
    "To give a good example about what a good Actual Temperature is: On Earth the Effective Temperature is 252 K and the Actual Temperature is 288 K (taking into account the Greenhouse Effect)\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the Actual Temperature you can use the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "T(actual) = \\sqrt[4]{\\frac{(1 + gamma) * (1 - a)}{4} * \\frac{R^2 * T^4}{r(orbit)^2}}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "What does each variable represent?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (1 + gamma) represent the percentage of light reflected back to the surface after already being reflected from the planet\n",
    "2. (1 - a) represents the amount of heat that is absorbed by the planet (a being the albedo or reflectiveness of a planet)\n",
    "3. R^2 and T^2, like before represent the radius and temperature of the Host star that the exoplanet revolves around\n",
    "4. The division by 4 comes from the fact that exoplanets absorb light like a disk but emit heat like a sphere\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, we do not have what the 'gamma' and 'a' values of the exoplanets are however we do have a column called 'pl_eqt' which stands for Equilibrium Temperature. This is very similar to Actual Temperature however its a theoretical temperature that an exoplanet would be heated only based on their host star. \n",

    "Wow! With this data we can see that normally the Equilibrium Temperature of the Exoplanets are smaller if the Stellar Effective Temperature is also smaller which makes sense since unless the exoplanet has a good gamma value and a relatively small albedo ('a') value, the exoplanet wouldn't be able to contain the heat therefore losing a lot of the heat that was radiated off their host star. On the other hand if they did have a good albedo and a good gamma value then in turn the exoplanet may be able to 'amplify' the heat that is radiated towards it and that will allow for a exoplanet that is orbiting a smaller Stellar Effective Temperature Star to be warm enough for potential life forms.\n",

    "Now that we have see the Equilibrium Temperature of the Exoplanets compared to their Host Stars Stellar Effective Temperature, lets break the data down some more. First lets see what the Equilibrium Temperature of the Exoplanets are compared to the radius of said exoplanets."

    "With the Habitable Zone we can see which exoplanets are capable of having liquid water and in turn may have potential life roaming around on the planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the Habitable Zone we can utilize the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "T(actual)^4 = \\frac{(1 + gamma) * (1 - a)}{4} * \\frac{R^2 * T^4}{r(orbit)^2}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we want to solve for r(orbit) we can rearrange the formula to take that into account. We are then left with the final formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "r(orbit) = \\sqrt[2]{\\frac{(1 + gamma) * (1 - a)}{4} * \\frac{R^2 * T^4}{T(actual)^4}}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "For these calculations we can be much more flexible regarding 'a' and 'gamma' values so we can actually utilize it to help get the Habitable Zone range. Since we know that Earth is in the Habitable Zone, we can utilize its albedo and gamma values so that we can say that within the habitable zone all planets would have the same albedo and gamma values, this allows for easier calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Earth's albedo = 0.3\n",
    "2. Earth's gamma = 0.6\n",
    "\n",
    "For T(actual) we can substitute the in the temperatures for when water boils and when water freezes as these would be the borders for where the Habitable Zone would lie since we would want liquid water on the planet and not steam or ice.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Water Freezes at 273.15 Kelvin\n",
    "2. Water Boils at 373.1 Kelvin\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know what we are solving for as well as the values to plug in, since the rest of the values depend on the Host Star, we can now start calculating for the Habitable Zone Range for the Exoplanet's Host Stars."

    "The linear regression line that our model predicts doesn’t obviously fit the data trend super well. This is because of the advancements made in technology used in the process of discovering exoplanets. As technology advances the ability to find exoplanets increases and that is why there is a spike in our data and why we can predict a spike in future data. Those spikes are short lived however since technology advances at a slow rate. Without a new advancement in technology, the number of possible exoplanets we can discover with current technology will be more and more limited each year after an initial technological advancement. This is where you can see the downward trend of discoveries after an initial spike in discoveries. \n",

    "1. When looking at all the exoplanets recorded with enough data help determine whether or not the exoplanet has the potential of life, we found that about 16 % (262 (Earth-like)/ 1549 (total planets)) of the exoplanets found were Earth like or potenitally a Super Earth\n",
    "2. We then found that many of the exoplanets found were within the frost line created by their host star which meant that many were terrestrial like planets\n",
    "3. Checking the Equilibrium Temperatures of the exoplanets we found that the predicted temperatures were relatively high however since they were predictions we took the values with a grain of salt and said that if a planet was within a range that could then fall into a more suitable range then it was a candidate for life\n",
    "4. Afterwards we solved for the habitable zone so that we could see whether or not the exoplanets were in this habitable zone which would greatly increase the odds of whether or not the exoplanet had the potential for life\n",
    "5. We then found the number of planets with enough data discovered per year and then use Linear Regression to create and train a model to predict how many exoplanets were found in 2021.\n",
    "6. Continuing to utilize Linear Regression we also counted how many potentially habitable exoplanets were discovered from the ones we counted and then predicted how many potentially habitable exoplanets would be found in 2021.\n",
    "7. Using both of the predicted values we then determined how many exoplanets found in 2021 would be exoplanets that had the potential for life, which came to around 3 %\n",

    "Observations based on our analysis and modeling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the massive number of exoplanets discovered in recent years we can conclude that finding a potential exoplanet that has the ability to harbor life is extremely small but, is not zero. As we found through our analysis a small percentage of the exoplanets have the potential to host life based on factors such as its placement compared to its star and location in comparison to the calculated frost line and habitable zone of the star. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we conducted further analysis, we would use more exoplanet data and expand the factors that we are using to define what a potentially habitable exoplanet would have to have in order to be a candidate. We would also try to cross check our calculations with more databases that may have had done similar experiments in order to access a better approach to classifying and identifying an exoplanet with the potential to host life. Lastly, we would try to find a way to utilize all exoplanets discovered instead of deleting many of them due to certain values of an exoplanet missing which has the potential to skew our predictions."
