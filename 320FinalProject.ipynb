Our goal in this project is to take the exoplanets already discovered and see what the probability of life on these planets real is and hope that a good amount of the exoplanets that we discovered so far fit well into the criteria of haveing the ability to hold life.\n",

Another issue that we have with this DataFrame is that the names, due to there being many columns, may not be very intuitive, so in order to be able to understand the column values quicker without a cheat sheet of what each column represents we want to change the column names.\n",
